### Notes
* A sort of idiosyncratic transcription system is used (combining Iranological and Indological conventions). See Arora et al. (2020) [pending review at JIPA] for more information on the transliteration system.
* Some of the verb inflectional categories are unclear, subject to revision (e.g. forms with the present in *-may*).

### Source
* Fieldwork data collected by Aryaman Arora with Ahmed Etebari (resident of Kholus, age 29, bilingual Kholosi and Persian). This has not been published anywhere yet.
